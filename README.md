# JARVIS

This is a Discord/Twitch(YouTube, Mixer, and Facebook support coming soon) bot designed to moderate chat in both and integrate between both userbases.
Things such as participation and raids will be rewarded with points.
These points will allow users to rank up to ranks such as bronze, silver, gold, or diamond.



Progress:
1. Bot responds to Discord Commands
2. Bot responds to Twitch Commands
3. Hosting will be done on Heroku (Heroku is now only a backup. Have a server available now.)
4. Automatically deploys from GitHub (New development branch is coming, so this is scrapped.)
5. Ranks can now be printed to Discord (Images need to be added. Make everything look pretty.)
6. Points can be earned simply by chatting in the Discord. With enough points you can rank up.
7. Bot is able to grab Twitch stream info.
8. Bot can now announce when a Twitch channel goes live.
9. Ranking system is now pretty. Generates an image banner on the fly for users.
10. Can now easily add/remove users to Twitch notifications.
11. Question of the Day will be sent out for chances for bonus points!
12. !8jarvis command allows JARVIS to act as a Magic 8-Ball.
